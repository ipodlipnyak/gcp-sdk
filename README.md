1. Set a project
2. Set a zone (`europe-west1-b` for example)
3. Select a machine type (`E1` for dev is best and costeffective)
4. Choose image family ((Container-Optimized OS)[https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/concepts/features-and-benefits] are good. Such as `cos-stable-105-17412-101-37`)
